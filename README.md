## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elmahrosa/ElMahrosa-Pi-Smart-City.git
   cd ElMahrosa-Pi-Smart-City
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your configuration:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/elmahrosa
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend services:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Authentication**: Users can register and log in to access the platform.
- **Crowdfunding**: Users can create and support crowdfunding projects.
- **Transactions**: Users can perform cryptocurrency transactions through the Web3 service.
- **Data Visualization**: Access real-time data from IoT devices and view analytics on the dashboard.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available in the `docs/api-specification.md` file. It includes details on all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

## Testing

To run tests for the backend services, navigate to each service directory and run:

```bash
npm test
```

For frontend tests, run:

```bash
cd frontend
 npm test
```
